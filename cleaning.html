Well you won't be the first or last to wonder just how to get rid of those marks on your pots. Now maybe you've ran out of your normal cleaning product or, like many of us, looking for that natural way to clean! Baking soda is the way to go! Try some baking soda with a litlle warm water(plus a little elbow grese!) and give them a good scrub!</p>

            <p id="left-text"><img src="assets/images/mop.png" alt="Person mopping the floor" style="float: right; vertical-align: baseline;">2. Now lets be honest, mopping the floor is not exactly a go to activity for fun? This doesn’texactly make it more fun, but it saves you looking for the floor cleaner in the back of the cupboard and it’s a little nicer to our planet earth.   Try 8 parts warm water, 1 part lemon juice, 1 part vinegar and then grate in some soap(whatever fragance you wish) for that fresh , clean smell.</p>

            <p id="right-text"><img src="assets/images/sink.jpg" alt="Picture of a sink" style="float: left; vertical-align: baseline;">3. Combine two cups of baking soda with 1/8th cup of cream of tartar (approximately two tablespoons) and a half cup of salt. Mix the solution in a jar by giving it a good shake. Pour two cups of boiling water down the drain and add your homemade mix. Let everything sit for at least an hour. The salt and baking soda will work on the clog, while the cream of tartar cleans metals.</p>

            <p id="left-text"><img src="assets/images/iron.jpg" alt="Picture of an iron" style="float: right; vertical-align: baseline;">4. Got a stubborn stain that just won't budge? Believe it or not, salt and newspaper can also get the job done. Flip your iron to the hottest setting and lay out a newspaper on your ironing board. Sprinkle a good amount of salt over the newspaper, and iron the salty newspaper in circles until it's clean. If you don't have a newspaper handy, you can use a brown paper bag—it works just as well.</p>
