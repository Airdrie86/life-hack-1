<h2>Life Made Easy:</h2>
<p>Life made easy is a website that consits of life hacks to make your life a lit bit easier and hopefully save you some precious time!
It's targeted at people who are looking for a quick fix to a problem or just looking for a better way to do the mundane things in life!
My aim was to make a minimilistic website that will catch the eye and hopefully get people not only to use the website but sign up for future newsletters.<p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>For the whole website and decided for a red/black color scheme throughout.<p>
<p>I wanted to keep the nav bar fixed, to make it easy for the user to navigate.<p>
<p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<p>Navigation Bar - Featured on all 5 pages the navigation bar includes links to the Home Page, Cleaning, Cooking and Students Page plus a final link for the page to register for the newsletter.
It's bold to catch the eye and is fixed to the page, so it's easier for the user to navigate to whichever page they choose.<p>

<h2>The landing page image:</h2>
<p>The image is their to draw the user in and also tell a story of the website without using any words. Their is a text overlay that gets gradually bigger. This is again to draw the user to the page plus also gives you a little bit of information to what this site is all about and to hope that they want to scroll down and be interested in what's about to be offered.<p>

<h2>Website Information:</h2>
<p>The main body of the page is to give you a description of what the site has to offer, my plan is to keep it brief and minamilistic as the site is about saving you time!
I also inclued clickable pictures, which are also bright to cath the eye, to make it easier for the user to navigate to the correct page.<p>

<h2>Webinar:</h2>
<p>I also added a seperate section for upcoming webinars. This gives times and dates to webinars that would help give the user more info and help on the relevant subjects. It also gives the user where to find the webinars and tells the user about the social media links placed in the footer below.<p>
<p>With this part I also hope to use such webinars and social media links to help the user but also help them return to one of our platforms and keep them coming back.

<h2>Footer:</h2>
<p>The footer is the same colour and font as the navigation to give some uniformity to the website and hopefully give a professional look to the user.
It has the social media links for Life Made Easy, which will open in a new tab as to east the navigation for the user.<p>

<h2>Cooking/Cleaning/Students Pages:</h2>
<p>For the 3 life hack pages, I wanted to keep a sense of uniformity with the home page. So you will see a similar colour scheme and layout.
For the hacks themselves I decided to alternate the pictures and text(First picture on the left hand side, 2nd on the right etc) to help the page standout out and also tried to find pictures that were not only relevant but had some colour and would stand out and draw the users eye towards it.<p>

<h2>Register:</h2>
<p>For the sign up page I decided I wanted to use a picture to be the background of the main body of the page. I wanted to, again, use a picture that spoke to what I wanted to portray for the website(More time to relax) and again catch the users eye.<p>
 <p>This page is to also help the user return to the website and/or social media platforms. The hope is that people sign up and then will get a newsletter that willl give new hacks and links to social medial platforms.<p>
